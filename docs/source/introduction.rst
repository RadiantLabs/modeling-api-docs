Introduction
==========================================
Radiant Labs has built a sophisticated software platform for city and state governments, utilities, and contractors to target ideal candidates
for building energy upgrades, fuel switching, renewable energy installations, and electric vehicle deployments. Our software can aggregate 
assessor, building permit, rooftop solar potential, utility bill, manufacturing, and energy program data to generate an hourly energy model 
and anticipated replacement timelines for mechanical
  
This Modeling API is Radiant Labs' primary tool to generate energy consumption models for homes.
